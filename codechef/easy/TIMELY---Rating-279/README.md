## Problem

### Reach on Time

Chef has recently moved into an apartment. It takes $30$ minutes for Chef to reach office from the apartment.

Chef left for the office $X$ minutes before Chef was supposed to reach. Determine whether or not Chef will be able to reach on time.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single integer $X$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output `YES` if Chef will reach on time, `NO` otherwise.

The output is case-insensitive. Thus, the strings `YES`, `yes`, `yeS`, and `Yes` are all considered the same.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 60$
- $1 \leq X \leq 60$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
6
30
60
14
29
31
42

```

```
YES
YES
NO
NO
YES
YES

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case 1:**  Chef leaves $30$ minutes before he is supposed to reach, so he will reach the office exactly on time since it takes $30$ minutes to commute.

 **Test case 2:**  Chef will reach $30$ minutes early.

 **Test case 3:**  Chef will reach 16 minutes late.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--){
	    int x;
	    cin>>x;
	    if(x>=30){
	        cout<<"YES"<<endl;
	    }
	    else{
	        cout<<"NO"<<endl;
	    }
	}

}

```
