## Problem

### Passes for Fair

There is a fair going on in Chefland. Chef wants to visit the fair along with his $N$ friends. Chef manages to collect $K$ passes for the fair. Will Chef be able to enter the fair with all his $N$ friends?

A person can enter the fair using one pass, and each pass can be used by only one person.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single line containing two space-separated integers $N, K$.
### Output Format

For each test case, print on a new line `YES` if Chef will be able to enter the fair with all his $N$ friends and `NO` otherwise.

You may print each character of the string in either uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings `yEs`, `yes`, `Yes`, and `YES` will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N, K \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
5 8
6 3
2 2
1 2

```

```
YES
NO
NO
YES

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Chef needs $5$ passes for his friends and one pass for himself and he collected $8$ passes. Thus he will be able to enter the fair with all his friends.

 **Test case $2$:**  Chef needs $6$ passes for his friends and one pass for himself while he collected only $3$ passes. Thus he will not be able to enter the fair with all his friends, only three of them can enter the fair.

 **Test case $3$:**  Chef needs $2$ passes for his friends and one pass for himself while he collected only $2$ passes. Thus either Chef or one of his friends can't enter the fair.

 **Test case $4$:**  Chef needs a total of $2$ passes, one for himself and one for his friend. He collected $2$ passes. Thus he will be able to enter the fair with his friend.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--)
    {
        int n,k;
        cin >> n>> k;

        if (n < k)
        {
            cout << "YES" << endl;
        }
        else
        {
            cout << "NO" << endl;
        }
    }
