## Problem

### Reach the Target

There is a cricket match going on between two teams $A$ and $B$.

Team $B$ is batting second and got a target of $X$ runs. Currently, team $B$ has scored $Y$ runs. Determine how many more runs Team $B$ should score to  **win**  the match.

 **Note: The `target score` in cricket matches is one more than the number of runs scored by the team that batted first**.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two space-separated integers $X$ and $Y$, the target for team $B$ and the current score of team $B$ respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, output how many more runs team $B$ should score to win the match.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $50 \leq Y \lt X \leq 200$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
200 50
100 99
130 97
53 51

```

```
150
1
33
2

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The target is $200$ runs and team $B$ has already made $50$ runs. Thus, the team needs to make $200-50 = 150$ runs more, to win the match.

 **Test case $2$:**  The target is $100$ runs and team $B$ has already made $99$ runs. Thus, the team needs to make $100-99 = 1$ runs more, to win the match.

 **Test case $3$:**  The target is $130$ runs and team $B$ has already made $97$ runs. Thus, the team needs to make $130-97 = 33$ runs more, to win the match.

 **Test case $4$:**  The target is $53$ runs and team $B$ has already made $51$ runs. Thus, the team needs to make $53-51= 2$ runs more, to win the match.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--){
	    int a,b;
	    cin>>a>>b;
	    cout<<a-b<<endl;
	}
}
