## Problem

### Candy Store

Chef has started working at the candy store. The store has $100$ chocolates in total.

Chef’s daily goal is to sell $X$ chocolates. For each chocolate sold, he will get $1$ rupee. However, if Chef exceeds his daily goal, he gets $2$ rupees per chocolate for each  **extra**  chocolate.

If Chef sells $Y$ chocolates in a day, find the total amount he made.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two space-separated integers $X$ and $Y$ — the daily goal of Chef, and the number of chocolates he actually sells.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the total amount Chef made in a day.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X, Y \leq 10$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
3 1
5 5
4 7
2 3

```

```
1
5
10
4

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Chef's daily goal was $3$. Since he sold only $1$ chocolate, he'll get only $1$ rupee.

 **Test case $2$:**  Chef's daily goal was $5$. Since he sold $5$ chocolates, he'll get $5$ rupees.

 **Test case $3$:**  Chef's daily goal was $4$. Since he sold $7$ chocolate, he'll get $4$ rupees for the $4$ chocolates as his daily goal and $2$ rupees per chocolate for the extra $3$ chocolates. The total amount he gets is $4+3\cdot 2 = 10$.

 **Test case $4$:**  Chef's daily goal was $2$. Since he sold $3$ chocolate, he'll get $2$ rupees for the $2$ chocolates as his daily goal and $2$ rupees per chocolate for the extra $1$ chocolate. The total amount he gets is $2+1\cdot 2 = 4$.

int main() {
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    while(t--)
    {
        int x,y;
        cin>>x>>y;
        // your code goes here
        if(x>y){
            cout<<y<<endl;
        }
        else{
            cout<<(((y-x)*2) + x)<<endl;
        }
        
    }
