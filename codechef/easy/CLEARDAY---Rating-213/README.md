## Problem

### Lucky Seven

Chef considers the number $7$ lucky. As a result, he believes that the $7$-th letter he sees on a day is his  *lucky letter*  of the day.

You are given a string $S$ of length $10$, denoting the first $10$ letters Chef saw today.
What is Chef's  *lucky letter* ?

### Input Format
- The only line of input contains a string $S$, of length $10$.
### Output Format
- Print a single character: Chef's lucky letter.
### Constraints
- $S$ has a length of $10$
- $S$ contains only lowercase Latin letters (i.e, the characters 'a' to 'z')
### Sample 1:
