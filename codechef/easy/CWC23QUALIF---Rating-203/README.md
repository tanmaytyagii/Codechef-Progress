## Problem

### Cricket World Cup Qualifier

The cricket World Cup has started in Chefland. There are many teams participating in the group stage matches. Any team that scores $12$ or more points in the group stage matches qualifies for the next stage.

You know the score that a particular team has scored in the group stage matches. Determine if the team has qualified for the next stage or not.

### Input Format

The first and only line of input consists of an integer $X$ denoting the total points scored by the given team in the group stage matches.

### Output Format

Output `Yes`, if the team has qualified for the next stage, and `No` otherwise.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yEs, yes, and yeS will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq X \leq 20$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output
