## Problem

### Right There

*If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party
Then put your hands up*

Chef wants to host a party with a total of $N$ people.
However, the party hall has a capacity of $X$ people. Find whether Chef can host the party.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two space-separated integers $N$ and $X$ — the total number of people and the capacity of the party hall.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, `YES`, if Chef can host the party and `NO` otherwise.

Each character of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase. That is, the strings `NO`, `no`, `nO`, and `No` will be treated as equivalent.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N, X \leq 10$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
2 5
4 3
6 6
10 9

```

```
YES
NO
YES
NO

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Chef wants to host a party with $2$ people. Since the capacity of the hall is $5$, he can host the party.

 **Test case $2$:**  Chef wants to host a party with $4$ people. Since the capacity of the hall is $3$, he can not host the party.

 **Test case $3$:**  Chef wants to host a party with $6$ people. Since the capacity of the hall is $6$, he can host the party.

 **Test case $4$:**  Chef wants to host a party with $10$ people. Since the capacity of the hall is $9$, he can not host the party.

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int n, x;
        cin >> n >> x;
        if (n <= x)
            cout << "Yes" << endl;
        else
            cout << "No" << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
