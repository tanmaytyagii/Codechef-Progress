## Problem

### Off By One

You just bought a new calculator, but it seems to have a small problem: all its results have an extra $1$ appended to the end.
For example, if you ask it for `3 + 5`, it'll print `81`, and `4 + 12` will result in `161`.

Given $A$ and $B$, can you predict what the calculator will print when you ask it for $A + B$?

### Input Format
- The first and only line of input will contain two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$.
### Output Format

Print a single integer: the calculator's output when you enter $A+B$ into it.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq A, B \leq 50$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3 5
```

```
81
```

### Explanation:

$3 + 5 = 8$, and the calculator appends a $1$ to print $81$.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
4 12
```

```
161
```

### Explanation:

$4+12 = 16$, and the calculator appends a $1$ to print $161$.

int main() {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    cout << 10 * (a + b) + 1 << endl;

}
