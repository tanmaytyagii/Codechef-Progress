## Problem

### Read Pages

Chef has started studying for the upcoming test. The textbook has $N$ pages in total. Chef wants to read at most $X$ pages a day for $Y$ days.

Find out whether it is possible for Chef to complete the whole book.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $N, X,$ and $Y$ — the number of pages, the number of pages Chef can read in a day, and the number of days.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, `YES`, if Chef can complete the whole book in given time, and `NO` otherwise.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase. For example, `Yes`, `YES`, `yes`, and `yES` are all considered identical.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq N \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X, Y \leq 10$
### Sample 1:

Output

```
4
5 2 3
10 3 3
7 7 1
3 2 1

```

```
YES
NO
YES
NO

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Chef can read two pages on the first day, two on the second day, and the remaining one on the third day.

 **Test case $2$:**  Chef cannot complete all ten pages in three days.

 **Test case $3$:**  Chef can read all seven pages in one day.

 **Test case $4$:**  Chef cannot complete all three pages in one day.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int n, x, y;
        cin >> n >> x >> y;
        if (n <= x * y) {
            cout << "Yes" << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "No" << endl;
        }
    }

}

```
