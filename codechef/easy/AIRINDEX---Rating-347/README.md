## Problem

### Air Quality Index

In the light of `G-20` summit, government has decided to keep the average air quality index (AQI)  **strictly below**  $100$.
On some random day, Chef measures the AQI and found the value to be $X$.

Find whether the government was able to keep the AQI within limits.

### Input Format
- The input consists of an integer $X$ — the AQI Chef measured.
### Output Format

Output `YES`, if the government was able to keep the AQI within limits and `NO` otherwise.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings `YES`, `yEs`, `yes`, and `yeS` will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq X \leq 150$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
50

```

```
YES

```

### Explanation:

The AQI is strictly less than $100$. Thus, the government was able to keep the AQI within limits.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
100

```

```
NO

```

### Explanation:

The AQI is equal to $100$. Thus, the government was not able to keep the AQI within limits.

### Sample 3:
Input
Output

```
99

```

```
YES
```

### Explanation:

The AQI is strictly less than $100$. Thus, the government was able to keep the AQI within limits.

### Sample 4:
Input
Output

```
145

```

```
NO
```

### Explanation:

The AQI is greater than $100$. Thus, the government was not able to keep the AQI within limits.
