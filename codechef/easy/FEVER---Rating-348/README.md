## Problem

### Fever

Chef is not feeling well today. He measured his body temperature using a thermometer and it came out to be $X$ °F.

A person is said to have fever if his body temperature is  **strictly greater**  than $98$ °F.

Determine if Chef has fever or not.

### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer $T$ — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains one integer $X$ - the body temperature of Chef in °F.
### Output Format

For each test case, output `YES` if Chef has fever. Otherwise, output `NO`.

You may print each character of `YES` and `NO` in uppercase or lowercase (for example, `yes`, `yEs`, `Yes` will be considered identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10$
- $94 \le X \le 103$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
98
100
96

```

```
NO
YES
NO

```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case 1** : Since $X = 98$ is not greater than $98$, Chef does not have fever.

 **Test Case 2** : Since $X = 100$ is greater than $98$, Chef has fever.

 **Test Case 3** : Since $X = 96$ is not greater than $98$, Chef does not have fever.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t, x;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        cin >> x;
        cout << (x > 98 ? "yes" : "no") << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
