## Problem

### Counting Words

Harsh was recently gifted a book consisting of $N$ pages. Each page contains exactly $M$ words printed on it. As he was bored, he decided to count the number of words in the book.

Help Harsh find the total number of words in the book.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two space-separated integers on a single line, $N$ and $M$ — the number of pages and the number of words on each page, respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, the total number of words in the book.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N \leq 100$
- $1 \leq M \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
1 1
4 2
2 4
95 42

```

```
1
8
8
3990

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The book consists of only $1$ page, and each page has only $1$ word. Hence, the total number of words is $1$.

 **Test case $2$:**  The book consists of $4$ pages, and each page has $2$ words. Hence, the total number of words is $2+2+2+2=8$.

 **Test case $3$:**  The book consists of $2$ pages, and each page has $4$ words. Hence, the total number of words is $4+4=8$.

 **Test case $4$:**  The book consists of $95$ pages, and each page has $42$ words. Hence, the total number of words is $3990$.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    for (int i = 1; i <= t; ++i) {
        int n, m;
        cin >> n >> m;
        cout << n * m << '\n';
    }

}
```
