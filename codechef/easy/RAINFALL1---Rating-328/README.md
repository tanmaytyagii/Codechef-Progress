## Problem

### Rain in Chefland

In Chefland, precipitation is measured using a rain gauge in millimetre per hour.

Chef categorises rainfall as:

- LIGHT, if rainfall is less than $3$ millimetre per hour.
- MODERATE, if rainfall is greater than equal to $3$ millimetre per hour and less than $7$ millimetre per hour.
- HEAVY if rainfall is greater than equal to $7$ millimetre per hour.

Given that it rains at $X$ millimetre per hour on a day, find whether the rain is `LIGHT`,` MODERATE`, or `HEAVY`.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single integer $X$ — the rate of rainfall in millimetre per hour.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, whether the rain is `LIGHT`,` MODERATE`, or `HEAVY`.

You may print each character in lowercase or uppercase. For example, `LIGHT`, `light`, `Light`, and `liGHT`, are all identical.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 20$
- $1 \leq X \leq 20$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
1
20
3
7

```

```
LIGHT
HEAVY
MODERATE
HEAVY
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The rate of precipitation is less than $3$. Thus, the rain is `LIGHT`.

 **Test case $2$:**  The rate of precipitation is greater than equal to $7$. Thus, the rain is `HEAVY`.

 **Test case $3$:**  The rate of precipitation is greater than equal to $3$ and less than $7$. Thus, the rain is `MODERATE`.

 **Test case $4$:**  The rate of precipitation is greater than equal to $7$. Thus, the rain is `HEAVY`.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int x;
        cin >> x;
        if (x < 3) {
            cout << "Light" << endl;
        } else if (x < 7) {
            cout << "Moderate" << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "Heavy" << endl;
        }
    }

}

```
