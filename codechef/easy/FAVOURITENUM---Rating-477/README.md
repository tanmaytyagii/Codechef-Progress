## Problem

### Favourite Numbers
- Alice likes numbers which are even, and are a multiple of 7.
- Bob likes numbers which are odd, and are a multiple of 9.

Alice, Bob, and Charlie find a number $A$.

- If Alice likes $A$, Alice takes home the number.
- If Bob likes $A$, Bob takes home the number.
- If both Alice and Bob don't like the number, Charlie takes it home.

Given $A$, find who takes it home.

 **Note:**  You can prove that there is no integer $A$ such that both Alice and Bob like it.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single integer, $A$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line who takes the number home - "Alice", "Bob", or "Charlie".

You may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, `Alice`, `alice`, `aLiCe`, and `ALICE` are all considered identical.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq A \leq 1000$

### Explanation:

 **Testcase 1:**  7 is not even, hence Alice doesn't like it. It is odd, but isn't a multiple of 9. Hence Bob doesn't like it. Therefore, Charlie takes it home.

 **Testcase 2:**  14 is even and a multiple of 7. Therefore, Alice likes it and takes it home.

 **Testcase 3:**  21 is not even, hence Alice doesn't like it. It is odd, but isn't a multiple of 9. Hence Bob doesn't like it. Therefore, Charlie takes it home.

 **Testcase 4:**  18 is even but not a multiple of 7, hence Alice doesn't like it. It is not odd, and hence Bob doesn't like it. Therefore, Charlie takes it home.

 **Testcase 5:**  27 is odd and a multiple of 9. Therefore, Bob likes it and takes it home.

 **Testcase 6:**  63 is odd and a multiple of 9. Therefore, Bob likes it and takes it home.

 **Testcase 7:**  126 is even and a multiple of 7. Therefore, Alice likes it and takes it home.

 **Testcase 8:**  8 is even but not a multiple of 7, hence Alice doesn't like it. It is not odd, and hence Bob doesn't like it. Therefore, Charlie takes it home.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    while(t--){
        int a;
        cin>>a;
        // your code goes here
        if(a%14 == 0){
            cout<<"Alice"<<endl;
        }
        else if(a%2!=0 && a%9==0){
            cout<<"Bob"<<endl;
        }
        else{
            cout<<"Charlie"<<endl;
        }
    }

}

```
