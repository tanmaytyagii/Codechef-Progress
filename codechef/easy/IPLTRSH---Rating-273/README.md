## Problem

### IPL Ticket Rush

DAIICT college students want to attend an IPL match.

A total of $N$ students from the college want to go while only $M$ tickets are available for the match.

Determine how many students won't be able to book tickets.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$ — the number of students wants to go and the total number of tickets available, respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the number of students who won't be able to book tickets.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq N, M \leq 10^{5}$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
5 3
5 7
4 1
8 8

```

```
2
0
3
0

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  There are $5$ students who want to go, and only $3$ tickets are available. Hence $2$ students won't be able to get tickets.

 **Test case $2$:**  There are $5$ students who want to go, and $7$ tickets are available. So, every one of them will get the tickets.

 **Test case $3$:**  There are $4$ students who want to go, and only $1$ ticket is available. Hence $3$ students won't be able to get tickets.

 **Test case $4$:**  There are $8$ students who want to go, and $8$ tickets are available. So, every one of them will get the tickets.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--){
	    int n,m;
	    cin>>n>>m;
	    if(m>n){
	        cout<<"0"<<endl;
	    }
	    else{
	        cout<<n-m<<endl;
	    }
	}

}
