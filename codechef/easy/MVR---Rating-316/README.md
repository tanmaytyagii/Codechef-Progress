Messi has $A$ goals and $B$ assists this season, whereas Ronaldo has $X$ goals and $Y$ assists.
Find out the player with more points this season.

### Input Format
- The first and only line of input will contains four space-separated integers $A$, $B$, $X$ and $Y$, the number of goals and assists that Messi has and the number of goals and assists that Ronaldo has, respectively.
### Output Format

- Equal, if both have equal points.

You can print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings `Messi`, `MESSI`, `messi`, and `MeSSi` are considered identical.

### Constraints

### Sample 1:

```

### Explanation:
- Messi has $40$ goals and $30$ assists. Thus, his total points are $40\cdot 2+30 = 110$.

Messi has $204$ points, whereas Ronaldo has $150$.

### Sample 3:
Input
Output

```
60 30 80 20
