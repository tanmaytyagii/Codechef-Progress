## Problem

### Chairs Requirement

Chef's coding class is very famous in Chefland.

This year $X$ students joined his class and each student will require one chair to sit on. Chef already has $Y$ chairs in his class. Determine the minimum number of new chairs Chef must buy so that every student is able to get one chair to sit on.

### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer $T$ — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $X$ and $Y$ — the number of students in the class and the number of chairs Chef already has.
### Output Format

For each test case, output the minimum number of extra chairs Chef must buy so that every student gets one chair.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $0 \leq X, Y \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
20 14
41 41
35 0
50 100

```

```
6
0
35
0

```

### Explanation:
- Test case 1: There are $20$ students in the class and Chef has $14$ chairs already. Therefore Chef must buy $6$ more chairs.
- Test case 2: There are $41$ students in the class and Chef already has exactly $41$ chairs. Therefore Chef does not need to buy any more chairs.
- Test case 3: There are $35$ students in the class and Chef has no chairs initially. Therefore Chef must buy $35$ chairs.

int main() {
	int T;
    cin >> T;
    while(T--){
    	int x,y;
    	cin >> x >> y;
    	cout << max(x-y,0) << endl;
    }

}
