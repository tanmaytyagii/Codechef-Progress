## Problem

### Couple Game

There are $G$ girl and $B$ boy students at IIT (BHU) such that $B \gt G$.

If ICM were a team game where teams could only be of size $2$, having  **exactly**  $1$ girl student and $1$ boy student, what would be the  **minimum**  number of boy students from IIT (BHU) who would not be able to participate?

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $G$ and $B$, the number of girl and boy students at IIT (BHU) respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line, the  **minimum**  number of boy students from IIT (BHU) who would not be able to participate.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq G \lt B \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
1 3
2 4
3 10
```

```
2
2
7
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  There is only $1$ girl and $3$ boys. So, one team can be formed, and minimum $2$ boys will be left behind.

 **Test case $2$:**  There are $2$ girls and $4$ boys. So, maximum $2$ teams can be formed, and minimum $2$ boys will be left behind.

 **Test case $3$** : There are $3$ girls and $10$ boys. So, maximum $3$ teams can be formed, and minimum $7$ boys will be left behind.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int g, b;
        cin >> g >> b;
        cout << (b - g) << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
